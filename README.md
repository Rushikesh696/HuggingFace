# Introduction-to-HuggingFace

**Hugging Face Pipelines**

This repository is a hands-on introduction to Hugging Face’s transformers library using the high-level Pipeline API.
It covers a variety of NLP and Computer Vision tasks with minimal code, making it beginner-friendly and practical for quick prototyping.

🌟 **What is Hugging Face?**

Hugging Face is an open-source platform and community that provides state-of-the-art pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Speech, and more.

The Transformers library allows you to:

Use pre-trained models in just a few lines of code.

Perform tasks like text classification, NER, summarization, QA, translation, text generation, vision tasks, etc.

Fine-tune models on your own datasets.

Integrate with tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

The Pipeline API is the simplest way to use these models:

from transformers import pipeline  

classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")  
result = classifier("I love Hugging Face!")  
print(result)

📚 Covered Tasks
📝 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Text Classification – Sentiment analysis, topic classification.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extract entities like names, dates, organizations.

Summarization – Generate concise summaries of text.

Question Answering – Answer questions from context passages.

Translation – Translate between languages.

Text Generation – Generate coherent text sequences.

Fill-Masking – Predict missing words in a sentence.

Feature Extraction – Get embeddings for downstream ML tasks.

🖼️ Computer Vision

Image Classification – Recognize objects in images.

Object Detection – Detect and localize objects.

Image Segmentation – Pixel-wise segmentation of images.


🚀 How to Use

Each notebook/script in this repo demonstrates a specific task using Hugging Face pipelines.

Example – Sentiment Analysis:

from transformers import pipeline  

sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")  
print(sentiment_pipeline("This repo is awesome!"))



🎯 Goal

By the end of this repo, you’ll:

Understand how to use Hugging Face Pipelines for multiple tasks.

Quickly apply pre-trained models without deep ML knowledge.

Have a starting point to fine-tune models for your own projects.
